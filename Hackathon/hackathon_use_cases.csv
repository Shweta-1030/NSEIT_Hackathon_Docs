1,"Text Analytics on 
Customer Feedback (Domain Agnostic)",Categories the customer feedback into predefined categories,"Premise: Insurance client has received data from their end customer
which has feedback reagrding their services and products.

Goal: Feedback data is present in CSV/Excel file. Feedback
is present in 11 Indian Languages, English and Higlish.
Every feedback comment needs to be labelled into a predefined
category which has been defined by Insurance company already.

gathered via different channels and can be used to generate Net Promoter Score (NPS) which measures the loyalty of a company's customer base with a score from -100 to +100, which comes from customers answering the question ""How likely are you to recommend this company to a friend or colleague?""",Requires access to Gen AI via APIs and Python coding language
2,"Fraud Detection for Car Insurance 
(Insurance)","Synthesize data, build, train and test fraud detection model 
to identify car insurance in real time","Premise: Auto Insurance company is not able to detect the frauds in real time as lots of false claims are being inaccurately settled.

Goal: Auto Insurance company wants to detect frauds in car insurance
claim settlement processes in real time using Gen AI capabilities.

Implementation Guidelines:
Let's say an insurance company wants to detect fraudulent claims for car accidents. They could use generative AI to generate synthetic data that is similar to real car accident claims data. This data could include information such as the following:

Type of car accident: This could include information such as the number of vehicles involved, the severity of the accident, and the location of the accident.
Severity of the accident: This could include information such as the number of injuries, the amount of property damage, and the cost of repairs.
Amount of the claim: This could include information such as the amount of medical expenses, the amount of property damage, and the amount of lost wages.
Claimant information: This could include information such as the name of the claimant, the address of the claimant, and the driver's license number of the claimant.
Insurance policy information: This could include information such as the policy number, the policy limits, and the deductible.
The generative AI could be used to generate synthetic data that is similar to this real car accident claims data. The data would be generated in a way that is statistically representative of real car accident claims data. This would allow the insurance company to train a fraud detection model that is accurate at identifying fraudulent claims.

Here are some examples of synthetic data that could be generated for this purpose:

Type of car accident: The generative AI could generate a variety of different types of car accidents, including single-vehicle accidents, multi-vehicle accidents, and hit-and-run accidents.
Severity of the accident: The generative AI could generate a variety of different severities of car accidents, ranging from minor accidents to fatal accidents.
Amount of the claim: The generative AI could generate a variety of different amounts for the claim, ranging from a few hundred dollars to millions of dollars.
Claimant information: The generative AI could generate a variety of different claimant information, including names, addresses, and driver's license numbers.
Insurance policy information: The generative AI could generate a variety of different insurance policy information, including policy numbers, policy limits, and deductibles.
The synthetic data could then be used to train a fraud detection model. The fraud detection model would learn to identify patterns of fraudulent behavior in the data. For example, the model might learn to identify claims that are made for accidents that are unlikely to have happened, or claims that are made for amounts that are significantly higher than the average amount for that type of accident.

Once the fraud detection model has been trained, it could be used to identify fraudulent claims in real car accident claims data. This could help the insurance company to identify fraudulent claims more quickly and efficiently.
 Customer specific PII data should be redacted and should not be sent to 
Gen AI Model to maintain client secrecy.","Auto Insurance companies can readily use this 
model built on synthetic data to detect frauds in real time",Requires access to Gen AI via APIs and Python coding language
